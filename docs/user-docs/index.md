description: Welcome to the Kelda documentation - Your personal development environment in the cloud that's lightweight, fast, and easy to use.

# Welcome to Kelda

Kelda gives each developer a personal development sandbox in your cloud that's
lightweight, fast, and easy to use.  Reduce the amount of time and energy you
spend managing Kubernetes so you can focus on coding.
